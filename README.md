# Anvw

a kind of google drive but self hosted.

# How it works ?

the program takes all the files in a local path and makes them sort of accessible through http requests.

## requeriments

- mysql / mariadb
- nodejs

# how to use it ?

welp the project is more of a learning project and is not made by any means to user usage, but if still want to give it a shot then follow these steps:

**updated** simply run `npm run run`

you should be able to get in http://localhost:port/

## routes

- /API/test //db status
- /API/play?path=pathtofile
- /API/files
- /watch?path=pathtofile
- /

# Main goals or prupose of this project
